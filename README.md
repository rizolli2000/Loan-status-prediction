# Loan-status-prediction
A loan status prediction model using  is a model that utilizes historical loan data to predict the likelihood of a loan being repaid or defaulted on. This model can be trained using various algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. The input data for the model includes information about the borrower, such as credit score, income, and employment history, as well as information about the loan, such as the loan amount, interest rate, and loan term. The model can then output a probability of the loan being repaid or defaulted on, which can be used by financial institutions to make informed decisions about loan approval and risk management.
